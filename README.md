My Calibration Values for the Formovie Theater projector

## Introduction
This projector is hard to calibrate and 

The idea is to have flesh tone brightness 5 points under red value


Example:

Red : 73

Flesh tone : 68


Avoid the advanced video setting "flesh tone"


And avoid Gamma bright (total BS or someone please explain it to me)


My full LLDV HDR values ( '=' when identical to projector central) note that I have a 92" vividstorm s pro


MAIN IMAGE SETTINGS :


Brightness : 48 =

Contrast : 83 ( depends on your DV EDID )

Saturation : 32 =

Hue: 0 =


GAMMA : middle (setting this to bright is something I don't understand and probably cause faded faces)


Color temperature (might be "cooler" than projector central's advised one but it's a compromise to keep good gamut coverage)


R: -2

G: -12

B: -28


Advanced video : every thing to off except: Hdmi rgb range: auto =

and color space : auto = (greyed out anyway)

Di film mode: auto (why does PC advise off is a mystery to me)


(Note that adaptive luma control to "middle" (other values are BS) can be great in SDR and can help in pure HDR too, but it's a matter of taste)
